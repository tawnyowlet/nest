  * Get warm water from tap rather than lightly warn water on stove (gets too hot)
  * Found that I needed more butter: Use 6 Tbs butter
  * Try the chicken breast with skin - will have rib bone. Easier to slather butter on top and below skin. Without skin hard for butter to stay on chicken
  * Your oven is good so follow heating time instructions - bet the skin will crisp up - so good!
